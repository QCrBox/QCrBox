# Quantum Crystallography Toolbox

*The future of small-molecule crystallography*

Welcome to QCrBox, a project to provide an open-source platform aimed at revolutionizing general and
quantum crystallography by addressing the field's core challenges: complex workflows, software
interoperability, and reproducibility barriers.

By integrating existing software into a unified, containerized environment, QCrBox aims to facilitate
the adoption of advanced crystallographic methods and spur the development of new tools. Our goal is
to streamline research processes, simplify software installation, enhance reproducibility, and improve
reporting standards.

We are currently working on completing the core framework. Feedback and collaboration is always welcome.

## Getting started

In order to get QCrBox up and running, it is currently necessary to create a development environment and build
the Docker containers locally on your machine. The how-to guide for that purpose is located
[here](https://qcrbox.github.io/QCrBox/how_to_guides/set_up_a_dev_environment/). In the future, we will also
distribute the underlying Docker containers fully built.


## Documentation
The documentation can be accessed [here](https://qcrbox.github.io/QCrBox/). Examples on how to interact with QCrBox
from the output can be found within the [wrapper folder](./wrapper/).


## Contributions

Contributions are always welcome, be it code or testing our software and raising issues. If you want to contribute
code, please create your own branch and submit a pull request. If you have any questions feel very welcome to contact us.
