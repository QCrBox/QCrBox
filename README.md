# Quantum Crystallography Toolbox

*The future of small-molecule crystallography*

Welcome to QCrBox, a project to provide an open-source platform aimed at revolutionizing general and quantum crystallography by addressing the field's core challenges: complex workflows, software interoperability, and reproducibility barriers. By integrating existing software into a unified, containerized environment, QCrBox hopes to facilitate the adoption of advanced crystallographic methods and spur the development of new tools. Our goal is to streamline research processes, simplify software installation, enhance reproducibility, and improve reporting standards.

We are currently working on completing the core framework. Feedback and collaboration is always welcome.

## Getting started
While the underlying docker containers are to be distributed fully built in the future, The only option is to create a dev environemnt at the moment. The HowTo for that purpose is located [here as a deployed website](https://qcrbox.github.io/QCrBox/how_to_guides/set_up_a_dev_environment/) or [here within the documentation in the repository](./docs/how_to_guides/set_up_a_dev_environment.md).

## Documentation
The documentation can be accessed [here](https://qcrbox.github.io/QCrBox/). Examples on how to interact with QCrBox from the output can be found within the [wrapper folder](./wrapper/).

## Built With
 - Docker
 - Python
