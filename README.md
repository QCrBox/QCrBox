# Quantum Crystallography Toolbox

*The future of small-molecule crystallography*

Welcome to QCrBox. This project provides an open-source platform aimed at revolutionizing general &
quantum crystallography by addressing the field's core challenges: complex workflows, software
interoperability, and reproducibility barriers.

QCrBox aims to facilitate the adoption of advanced crystallographic methods and spur the development
of new tools by integrating existing software into a unified, containerized environment. Our goal is
to streamline research processes, simplify software installation, enhance reproducibility, and improve
reporting standards.

We are currently working on completing the core framework. [Feedback and collaboration](#get-in-touch)
is always welcome.

## Getting started

In order to get QCrBox up and running, it is currently necessary to create a development environment and build
the Docker containers locally on your machine. The how-to guide for that purpose is located
[here](https://qcrbox.github.io/QCrBox/how_to_guides/set_up_a_dev_environment/). In the future, we will also
distribute the underlying Docker containers fully built.


## Documentation
The documentation can be accessed [here](https://qcrbox.github.io/QCrBox/). This includes
[examples](https://qcrbox.github.io/QCrBox/tutorials/contents/) on how to interact with QCrBox
from the outside. These examples are converted from Jupyter notebooks. If you'd like to run
them interactively, you can find them in the directory `docs/tutorials/examples/`.


## Contributions

Contributions are always welcome, be it code or testing our software and raising issues. If you want to contribute
code, please fork the repository, create your own branch and submit a pull request. If you have any questions feel
very welcome to [contact us](#get-in-touch).
