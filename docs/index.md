!!! welcome "Welcome to QCrBox!"

    QCrBox is an open-source platform aimed at revolutionizing general &
    quantum crystallography by addressing the field's core challenges: complex workflows, software
    interoperability, and reproducibility barriers.

    By integrating existing software into a unified, containerized environment, QCrBox aims to facilitate
    the adoption of advanced crystallographic methods and spur the development of new tools. Our goal is
    to streamline research processes, simplify software installation, enhance reproducibility, and improve
    reporting standards.

    We are currently working on completing the core framework. Feedback and collaboration is always welcome.
