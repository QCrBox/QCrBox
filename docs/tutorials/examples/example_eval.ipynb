Secondly, you should see an input prompt in your execution engine for this notebook. (In Jupyter this should be at the end of the cell, in VSCode it is at the top). By pressing enter within this prompt we tell QCrBox that we are done following the example. Subsequently QCrBox will try to run a few programs to produce a cif file with the output via Evals output to SADABS' .sad format. There is no cif file at the beginning of an integration.
