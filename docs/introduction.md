!!! welcome inline "Welcome to QCrBox!"

    QCrBox is an open-source platform aimed at revolutionizing general & quantum crystallography
    by addressing the field's core challenges: *complex workflows, software interoperability,
    and reproducibility barriers*.

    QCrBox aims to facilitate the adoption of advanced crystallographic methods and spur the development
    of new tools by integrating existing software into a unified, containerized environment. Our goal is
    to streamline research processes, simplify software installation, enhance reproducibility, and improve
    reporting standards.

    We are currently working on completing the core framework. Feedback and collaboration is always welcome.
